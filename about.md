# About the author

Have you ever struggled with questions about who God really is? You're not alone. Many of us have wrestled with doubts, and sadly, some have walked away from faith altogether — not because they rejected God, but because they had a distorted picture of His true character.

I understand this personally. I once left Christianity entirely, disillusioned by the hypocrisy I witnessed in [the church](https://church.ofgod.info). But then something unexpected happened — I had a personal encounter with God that changed everything. This encounter led me on an unconventional journey of rediscovery, exploring various Christian traditions from megachurches to house churches, engaging with traditional protestant, charismatic, and messianic congregations. Through it all, I've spent years asking hard questions about God, the Bible, and what it truly means to follow Christ.

Because I've experienced both the doubt that drives people away and the grace that draws us back, I can genuinely identify with anyone who questions God or struggles with faith.

## A Shared Journey of Discovery

Throughout this journey, I've become increasingly fascinated by what the Bible teaches about God.

This website is the fruit of that ongoing exploration. I'm still learning, still discovering new depths in familiar passages, and still amazed by how much there is to understand about [our Father God](https://ofgod.info) and His [son](https://son.ofgod.info) Jesus who is the Christ and our Lord.

### The Heart Behind This Website

This website has two primary purposes that I believe can transform how we experience faith:

**First, to reveal God's true character.** Many misconceptions about God which cause unnecessary fear and doubt. When we discover who God truly is through Scripture, everything changes. We see a Father who is loving, faithful, and deeply invested in relationship with us.

**Second, to explore what it means to trust God in our daily lives.** It's one thing to know about God; it's another to trust Him with our real struggles, decisions, and hopes. Together, we'll explore why trusting God matters, what areas of our lives we can confidently entrust to Him, and how we can practically live in that trust today—even in our complex modern world.

Along this journey, we'll also discover what the Bible teaches about [the Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info), a theme that transforms how we understand Jesus' mission and our place in God's eternal plan.

You'll find here careful attention to biblical texts, exploration of themes that intrigue me, and honest wrestling with questions that many of us have wondered about. Some topics might be unfamiliar. Some interpretations might differ from what you've heard before. That's okay — in fact, that's part of the journey.

### Full Transparency

I write independently, not affiliated with any church or organization, and without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's word leads without institutional constraints.

I encourage you to critically evaluate everything your read. Not just on this website, but always pray about any Christian content from any source you receive. I admit that I have been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll likely make more mistakes. That's why I genuinely invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you spot them. Your wisdom, your insights, and your questions make this a richer resource for everyone who visits.

### An Invitation to Explore

Rather than asking you to accept my conclusions, I invite you to examine the Bible for yourself. The content here is designed to point you back to God's word, to raise questions worth pondering, and to provide tools for your own study.

As you explore this site, I encourage you to:
- Test everything against the Scripture (Acts 17:11)
- Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and discernment
- Engage thoughtfully with ideas that might be new to you
- Share what you discover with others

Whether you read one article or explore the entire site, my prayer is that it draws you closer to God's love and your position in His eternal Kingdom.

Join me in this journey of discovery, exploring together what it means be a child of our Father God.
