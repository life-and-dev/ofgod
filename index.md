# Our Father God

Have you ever struggled to understand who God really is? 

Perhaps you've wondered whether you can truly trust Him, or maybe you've questioned what His character is actually like. Many people carry misconceptions about God—viewing Him as distant, angry, or unpredictable. For some, these distorted views stem from painful experiences with earthly fathers who fell short. For others, religious traditions have obscured the true picture of who God is. The tragedy is that many don't know what the Bible actually reveals about His nature and personality.

Christians typically call God "our Heavenly Father" because that is how Jesus introduced Him (Matthew 6:9, 11:27; Luke 11:2; John 17:1-5). But this title only begins to describe who He is. In this article, we'll explore the comprehensive picture of God that Scripture provides, examining His many [titles](#titles-of-god), [attributes](#attributes-of-god), and [personal characteristics](#personality-of-god) so you can discover for yourself the Father that Jesus intended to reveal.

## How the Bible Identifies God

God's name is transliterated from Hebrew as [YHVH](https://eternal.family.co.za/god/father/name) also known as the tetragrammaton. This name is found in Genesis 2:4-9, 4:26; Psalm 83:18, 118:27; Isaiah 11:2 and is commonly translated as "[LORD](https://eternal.family.co.za/god/father/name#lord)" in the Old Testament and "[Lord](https://eternal.family.co.za/god/father/name#lord)" in the New Testament. God's name is often pronounced "Yahweh" or "Jehovah".

## Knowing God Personally

This comprehensive study of God's titles, attributes, and personality reveals a Father who is infinitely more wonderful than many imagine. Yet even this extensive exploration is by no means the full revelation of God. It serves as an invitation for you to study the Bible yourself and discover the depths of His character that no single article could contain.

Jesus didn't come merely to teach theological truths about God; He came to introduce you personally to the Father, to tear down the barriers between you and Him, and to make a way for you to know Him intimately.

God is not a religious system to be studied from a distance. He is a Person who can be pursued and known. He is near to those who call upon Him (Psalm 145:18), willing to reason with you (Isaiah 1:18), and He reveals Himself to those who seek Him with all their heart (Jeremiah 29:13). The Father who created you, who knows every detail of your life, who is compassionate and abounding in love, to name only a few qualities of God. 

This God invites you into relationship with Him.
